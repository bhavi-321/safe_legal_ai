During such permitted period, Network 1 shall not terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section D(iii) for such competitive activity.",
        "risk_explanation": "The rewritten clause contradicts the official risk definition by explicitly permitting Affiliate to compete with Network 1 in a narrowly defined geographic area (State X) and timeframe (12 months). This directly allows competitive conduct that would otherwise be prohibited, thereby nullifying the 'Party A shall not compete with Party B' restriction within the specified parameters. The provision is narrowly tailored by limiting both geography and duration."

However, it is narrowly tailored through two limitations: (1) geographic restriction ('outside the Contract Territory') and (2) temporal restriction ('no earlier than six months following the expiration of the Contract Period').

        "risk_explanation": "This revised clause directly contradicts the risk definition 'Party A shall not compete with Party B' by explicitly **permitting** competitive activities (clinical trials and sales of Competing Products) that were previously prohibited.
